    <h1 class="mb0">Hi, I'm Sami</h1>
    <p>Call me a multi-faceted creator. I am a brand and CX manager driven by product/brand accessibility (social, physical, and emotional) and usability. I love creating, iterating, and getting outside.</p>

    <p>Growing up, I loved making connections between anything and everything. Seeing how the world interacted with itself fascinated me. Now, I've taken that fascination and not only applied it in my work, however go that extra step by helping other see the connections as well. Whether it's product development, brand marketing, or graphic design, engaging users through connections is critical and something I love to explore and improve.</p>
