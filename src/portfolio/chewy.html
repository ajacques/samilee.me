<p>In the midst of COVID-19, I was tasked with researching how COVID-19 was impacting new pet parents' purchasing
	behavior, specifically on <a href=https://www.chewy.com/>Chewy.com </a> and <a
		href=https://www.chewy.com/b/new-pet-2282>Chewy's New Pet Essentials page</a>. <br>Questions that we were
		looking to answer were:
		<ul>
			<li>What items do new dog owners deem as essential for new pet ownership?</li>
			<li>Could customers find those items on-site?</li>
			<li>What contributed to higher add to cart rates?</li>
			<li>What is the impact of navigation and heirarchy laid out on-site?</li>
			<li>What makes the customer feel like they had a successful shopping journey?</li>
		</ul>

<h2 class="mb0">The Approach</h2>
<p>Due to scope and timelines, I focused in on new puppy/dog owners. 10 participants were chosen to be interviewed from
	a wide a background of online shopping history. The cohort included customers with little online shopping history
	was crucial to understand the customer who has just gotten a dog but cannot shop in person due to COVID-19 retail
	restrictions. These interviews were conducted via Web Video applications (Zoom, Chime, Google Meets, etc) to capture
	customer facial expressions, as well as see their exact screen / shopping journey via screen share capabilities. A
	full research plan can be found <a

<h2 class="mb0">The Results</h2>
<p>The most noteable findings from Chewy.com for new dog owners included:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Prices [Positive sentiment]</strong> - 9 out of 10 customers mentioned positive price related aspects in
		their shopping journey, from discounts on individual products, Auto-ship savings, browsing the deals page, and
		more. </li>
	<li><strong>Product information [Negative sentiment]</strong> - All 10 customers throughout the interview mentioned
		they would go off-site to validate / do further research on the products prior to purchase. One new dog owner
		said, “Help me understand the world that I’m entering.”</li>
	<li><strong>Recommendations [Neutral sentiment]</strong> - All customers interacted and spent time on the “Customers
		also bought” and “Recommended products” for the add to cart page. 4 out of 10 customers explicitly mentioned
		that they like to look at these products both in the add to cart as well as the product detail page to ensure
		that they are getting the best item or not missing anything.</li>
</ul>
