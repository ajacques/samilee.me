<h2 class="mb0">Background</h2>
<p>With the refresh of Amazon Pets brand, I tested the Amazon Pets storefront and navigation to optimize for customer
    experience. Customer feedback themes from testing showed our old CX provided confusing messages and an interface
    that required much more thinking compared to competitor sites.
</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of this refresh were to decrease storefront abandonment rate and increase Amazon Pets GMS.
</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Process</h2>
<p>Operating within the brand guide was provided by our brand team, I mapped what are important messages Amazon Pets
    needs to communicate to customers.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Amazon Pets has everything you need for your pet ownership journey.</li>
        <li>Amazon Pets cares about pets and can help with your pet ownership journey.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>As a storefront, the key elements needed on the page were defined by the messages and standard Amazon.com storefront
    components. The derived list of elements is as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Header</li>
        <li>Navigation</li>
        <li>Featured partner brand banners and placements</li>
        <li>Editorial pet care tips with product / brand integration</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Deep diving into each component (aside from the header), I wanted all parts to communicate at least one, if not both
    of the messages to customers.
</p>

<h3 class="mb0">Navigation</h3>
<p>Pet type was the first level of consideration a pet owner makes in deciding what to purchase for their pet. Therefore
    displaying all major pet types was crucial for communicating that Amazon.com has everything needed for pet
    ownership.
    <br>
    Previously, the Pets storefront had buttons displaying all pet types and allowed the user to navigate from the
    buttons. In order to enable users to make quicker decisions, have less cognitive load, and save mobile
    above-the-fold space I decided to replace the text buttons with a horizontal scrolling navigational widget that
    showcased a graphic illustration of each pet.

<h3 class="mb0">Feature partner placements</h3>
<p>We previously showed simply a logo, however found that the CTR was low. To increase visual messaging, each brand logo
    had an image shown next to their logo to communicate what their brand is and for what type of pet it is for.
    Lifestyle imagery connects the customer to the brand and products by enabling them to envision their pet with that
    product, further communicating that Amazon.com has items to help with pet ownership.

<h3 class="mb0">Editorial pet care tips</h3>
<p>While Amazon Pets had editorial pet care tips on-site, they were buried in the Amazon Pets CX. To further highlight
    that Amazon Pets cares about pets and can help with pet ownership, I began to showcase seasonally relevant care tips
    with recommended brands and products. This component further encouraged customers to browse and start building trust
    for Amazon Pets in the care department.

<h2 class="mb0">Results</h2>
<p>The refreshed storefront enabled dynamic scheduling instead of quarterly scheduling, reducing 40 merchandising hours
    every quarter. Comparing storefront metrics showed the refreshed page had an increased log OPS by a range of 0.01% to
    0.78% and increased conversion by a range of 0.07% to 0.88%.</p>
