<h2 class="mb0">Objective</h2>
<p>Community is a main pillar in the Amazon Pets vision statement. However, our campaigns and roadmaps seemed fragmented
    from our customers and the pet community. I was tasked with solving how Amazon Pets should be involved with the
    community, but more importantly create customers trust and positive brand sentiment for Amazon Pets.</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of this event were to introduce Amazon Pets to the pet charity community, establish a presence within local
    pet communities, and create a unified online and offline experience for customers.</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Process</h2>
<p>Taking a look at pet ownership journeys, the moment where an owner first gets their pet is one of the most impactful
    moments for pet owners. I wanted to celebrate that moment as well as introduce Amazon Pets as being a partner with
    pet owners in that moment, creating an affinity for Amazon Pets as they consider their pets’ needs.
    <br>
    Digging into who the owners are, a large majority of owners look into pet adoption. The adoption space provided
    opportunity to partner with charities while also amplifying the good work and messages that many pet charities are
    working towards.
    <br>
    October was already <i>Adopt a Shelter Dog Month</i>, so in that timeframe, I wanted to create an event that
    celebrated adoption and the stories of adopted dogs. Throughout the month, we partnered with 20 pet charities
    throughout the US as well as AmazonSmile, had 60 Treasure Truck sampling activations and 3 large scale Treasure
    Truck “Pup-Fest”.
</p>

<h2 class="mb0">Results</h2>
<p><i>Adopt a Shelter Dog Month</i> consisted on both an online storefront celebrating the event and telling adoption
    success stories, and physical <i>Pup-Fest</i> adoption events with Amazon Treasure Truck.</p>

<p>Internal Amazon.com marketing placements were turned on for the event. To reach external customers, we partnered with
    pet charities to also post about the online event experience and physical event experience.</p>

<p>“Adopt a Shelter Dog Month” was a success based off the relationships with shelters that were formed, Treasure Truck activations, and storefront traffic. There were approximately 1.6K people in attendance for the Treasure Truck activations, we secured 442M external media impressions reaching over 8.4 unique media viewers, and brought in vendors to also enhance the experience. The response from the community as well as shelters surpassed expectations with the community spending an average of 1.5 hours at the physical events, shelters wanting to participate with Amazon Pets in the future, and event storefront traffic reaching XCM event storefront level traffic at peak.</p>
