<p>This is a personal project that was born during quarantine. With the lack of human interaction and the need to cope
    with emotionally draining events going on, I wanted to create something that uplifted myself and others.
</p>
<h2 class="mb0">Process</h2>
<p>I began by questioning, “Who in my personal life do I find inspirational and why?” I wanted to answer this question
    very personally, then extend it out to a broader cohort. In this process, I found that as I was looking outward and
    seeing people for their strengths, I was also searching inward and challenging my own notions of what society has
    traditionally deemed as inspiring.

    The styling of the photos encapsulates light shadowing, to attempt to generalize the figure while still reflecting
    some life.
